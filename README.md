# Wildfire Houston

To assist wildfire victims, we have created **Wildfire Houston**, a platform that directs users to services offered by associations and relief organizations.

## Database

We use **Weaviate** as our database to store service information.

Here is the schema:

- **Service Name**  
- **Service Description**  
- **Link**  

## Service Crawler

A script that indexes services and saves them in the database.

## Frontend

A web interface that allows users to search for services.
